this is a demo news application for my _news automata_ class at the New School.

it just provides a form to input some article url, and will return articles discussing
the same thing in the form of summaries with a social media popularity score.

the articles are not fetched/scraped/etc dynamically but rather loaded from a corpus of
politics and world news articles collected over the last several months by
[argos.corpora](https://github.com/publicscience/argos.corpora) (at time of writing this is about ~50k articles).
